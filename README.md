mrc_simple_filter
===========

This is a collection of programs for applying simple filters to MRC files (3D volumetric image files typically generated by electron tomography).

## programs included with this repository:

After compilation, all programs will be located in the "*bin/*" subdirectory.  Here is a brief description of a few of them:


### convolve_mrc


**convolve_mrc** applies a filter to a tomogram in the X,Y,Z directions
and saves the result as a new .mrc/.rec file.
This program can be used to rescale or invert a 3-D image,
remove its high or low spatial frequencies,
(smoothing, edge detection, band pass filter).
and perform 3-D blob detection.
Currently, the program supports the following list of filters:
(generalized) Gaussians,
(generalized) Difference-of-Gaussians,
Lapplacian-of-Gaussians, and others.
Both isotropic and anisotropic filters are supported.
(Fast separable filters are used when possible.)
Detailed documentation for this program is located in the "*doc/*" subdirectory.


### merge_mrc
**merge_mrc** is a program for combining two volumetric images (i.e. tomograms, both of identical size) into one image/tomogram, using a combination of addition, multiplication, and thresholding operations.  These features can be used perform binary operations between two images which are similar to "**and**" and "**or**" operations.  ("**not**" operations are also possible.)  As with the "*filter_gauss*" and "*filter_dog*" programs, you can also use the "-mask" argument to restrict the operation to certain voxels from the image.  (See the documentation for that tool for details.)
Detailed documentation for this program is located in the "*doc/*" subdirectory.



## Compilation instructions:

The programs are located inside separate directories inside the "bin"
subdirectory.  However before you compile those programs, you must
compile the libraries first.

### Step 1:
   if you use bash or sh:
```
   source setup_gcc.sh
```

if you use csh or tcsh:
```
   source setup_gcc.csh
```

### Step 2: compile the libraries

```
   cd lib
   make clean
   make depend
   make
```

### Step 3: compile the program

You have to cd to the directory that contains the program you want to compile:
cd ../bin/subdirectory_of_interest

```
   make clean
   make depend
   make
```
